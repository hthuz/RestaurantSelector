The restaurant is clean. They have a very nice selection on their menu. I just basically got their sandwich croissant. My friends also actually recommended this fast food restaurant and told me to get their sandwich croissant, so I did. I specifically got the bacon and egg sandwich croissant. It was reasonably priced. It tastes delicious. The croissant was very fresh; all of the ingredients were actually fresh. It is so simple, but it tastes delicious. The portions were also good. That was definitely a good sandwich. It is also a nice quick spot for breakfast. They have a wide selection on their menu that is quite interesting, so I will probably go back and try other foods on their menu.

For SO MANY YEARS, dating back to 2003, the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich by Panera Bread was my daily delicious nourishment! Sometime around 2009, I stopped eating this sandwich cold turkey (for no specific reason) and have craved it not ever since... until recently. The free one-month unlimited coffee by Panera lured me into their bakery last month. And the little ordering touch screens lured me to see if my delicious sandwich still existed. AND YES. IT DOES. So for the past couple of days when fetching my coffee, I've been tempted to see if I can easily build my own version of the sandwich (no feta, extra peppadew, extra cucumber, extra red onions, no emerald greens, add spinach), and oh my gosh it played out perfectly! In the olden days, relying on a human for my many special requests was always risky. The little ordering tablets ensured that I could have it my way. The only difference between my old school sandwich and now is that I no longer eat dairy (that started in 2010 hence the no feta request)... and the sandwich would absolutely be incomplete without a cheeselike addendum; but Panera already resolved that issue because the sandwich now comes with hummus! So I ordered extra! AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS! It was a perfect experience from ordering to receiving to eating. My head was on cloud nine. This bakery did a phenomenal job. In fact, I have since ordered this sandwich six more times in the past week! I am in love. Thank you so much for the careful time that your bakery invests into being kind to the customers and to executing a perfect sandwich construction!

The restaurant allows for seating of 6-10 and all participants must participate in the experience. If you're celebrating a special occasion and want to pair that with a nice rare Wine, they so allow BYOB with corkage ($45/bottle) for up to 2 std sized bottles of your own wine.\n\nFor the food, we started off with an outrageously delicious olive bowl with assorted Spanish style olives in warm Olive oil brine. Then we moved on to an empanada and endive salad which was a perfect combination pair. Then on the stupendously well seasoned quail (poultry) plate with delicious croutons. Next was the super indulgent warm seafood platter with oysters, prawns, and lobster tails. That was chased with the grand offering of their signature meat platter filled to the brim with sweetbreads, short ribs, blood sausage, chorizo, and massive ribeyes. Surprisingly, the red meat platter was decent but the weakest of the courses when it came to seasoning and quality. Short ribs were a little too fatty and rubbery, ribeye was average quality.\n\nWe finished with a dessert platter which had amazingly delish alfajores and ice creams.\n\nOverall, great celebrating. Bill was $135 for food with tax and tip included, and the rest was for cocktails and bottles of wine (which varies for each party )", "date": 1660527039, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117902824961667644168/reviews"}, {"ID": 135, "rating": 3, "comment": "Compared to other Mediterranean restaurants in chitown, I felt this was an okay experience.

I also threw in a sausage, egg & cheese McGriddle because why the heck not would I miss out on that goodness?\n\nMy order was prepared pretty quick and soon I left, food in hand. How did the food taste? Meh. I already guessed the cheesy bacon fries were going to use cheap nacho cheese, but man I didn't expect it to be that bad. The cheap, salty cheese and bacon combined with the fact that McDonald's fries are already extremely salted makes for a devastatingly sea salt level dish. I felt like I was going to dry up like a snail from just the first couple of fries. The amount of cheese and bacon on a $4 menu item was also terrible. I mean you're using the cheapest cheese you can find and you only put a little dab in the middle? Not good.\n\nThe Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger was also very flat in terms of taste and surprisingly salty. The thing about onions too is that if you're using cheap, bad quality onions, cutting them into big chunks makes it all more obvious which is what happened here. Sauteed onions would've been a better option. The gouda cheese was perfectly melted and very mild so it didn't add much in terms of flavor. As I was eating it I forgot there was even sauce on it as I was mostly tasting salt.\n\nTomato & Mozzarella chicken sandwich was decent. It sure does look good though. There's some sauce here as well, but the theme of strange saltiness & bad thick cut onion chunks continued here. I swear it almost seemed like they cut up half 1/3 of an onion and tossed it on here. Taking away the onions made it a much better sandwich. The chicken was crisp albeit a little dry.\n\nAh, and finally we have dessert. How can you go wrong with added Stroopwafels to a McFlurry? You can't! This was the best of the bunch with the caramel stroopwafel chunks meshing in perfectly with the Mcflurry. They even coated the top of the cup in caramel. McDonald's gets an A+ on this one and should definitely make it a regular menu item. As a quick mention the McGriddle was good. Hard to go wrong there.\n\nOverall the food is a mixed bag. I don't know where McDonald's went wrong that made everything so salty and it seems whoever works the onion station absolutely LOVES onions.

I started an ONAB(Occupy Not Al's Beef)(Get it?) movement and started a signature signing for those who promised to boycott it after it opened. But all those hours of protesting and boycotting, I got pretty hungry and after it opened the beef smelled so good I had to try it.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what, the food is pretty good. Its a mess of dripping beef and gooey cheese and salty fries. Make sure you get the sandwich dipped, that is if you know whats good for you. They have a million different types of greasy fries, I would recommend the loaded fries. You will be sure to gain at least 5lbs every time you eat here... That is if you are living life the right way, and order what I described above.\n\nThis particular location has been sparse with people and I wonder if its because the prices are just a little too high for the neighborhoods taste. Clearly I am a fatty mcfatterson (if you couldn't tell by the above recommended meal) and would like to eat fast food meals for cheap.

It is a different feel as you order from the QR code on the table and the food is brought to you as it is prepared. There was a layer of confusion when my husband ordered. I ordered the appetizer (fried green tomatoes, no pic) and O thought he ordered out food. He only ordered 1 shrimp & grits, not 2. The waitress saw his discontent and my confusion/sympathy. I requested a container so that we could leave. As I was putting my food in the container, the waitress comes over with a piping hot plate of Shrimp & grits\u2026on the house! She expressed that she felt bad for the miscommunication. I greatly appreciated that. The cook time is lengthy. Also, if you order your appetizer first, it shouldn\u2019t appear with your main entree.\n\nThe fried green were good but with add more sauce on the plate or provide some as a dipping sauce. The breading needs a touch more flavor.\n\nThe Shrimp & Grits\u2026the tails are still on the shrimp. That\u2019s disappointing.\n\nI will follow the recommendations of ordering first but you run the risk of having nowhere to sit if you plan to dine in.

It was delicious and worthy of my visit across the globe.\n\nRibs were tender and meaty, not overly greasy and definitely not dry from the BBQ.\n\nHowever, do note that it can get crowded and be very hot waiting just to place your order which is in the air conditioned indoors. Tentage waiting area has no air circulation and it was very hot just waiting out for your turn. So be prepared to be \"BBQ\" before your order if you're making a visit during the summer.\n\nOther than that, i think the food's great.", "date": 1653766607, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114622773393750118401/reviews"}, {"ID": 716, "rating": 4, "comment": "I enjoyed the brisket,flavor was on point meat was so tender a nice portion was given with the sandwich.

One for me and my daughter and a kids grilled cheese meal for my 19 month old granddaughter. I never used them before so I didn't know how they came so I didn't give them any instructions. But next time I will ask them to make the beacon crispy. It comes with soft beacon. I don't like that. But that wasn't their fault, I didn't know how it came. But I know for next time. I did appreciate the way they made the grilled cheese. They must be baby conscience, because they really didn't toast it. It was soft for little mouths and I liked that they didn't use white bread. Kudos to them for not using pasty white bread. They used rye.  Other than the beacon, the sandwich was really good. I scarfed it down. My daughter loved it. She came home after a long hard day at school, and was met by that delicious sandwich. Put her in a good mood THANK YOU! LOL!!! Oh yes and the fries were awesome. The baby loved them.

Normally I have another go to place just down Milwaukee that rhyme as with Zasabi, but decided to give furious a try again on a night when my #1 wasn\u2019t taking pickup orders. What a mistake indeed- O was left with a Ramen size craving and empty stomach because half of our party LITERALLY threw away their food, it was so bland!\n\nThe pros here I guess are that they are right around the corner from me and pretty fast with orders\u2026 but like so is Taco Bell, and at least their food doesn\u2019t taste like gruel.

Big sad for cold ramen.\n\nOnce we all settled in and reheated the broth, we opened our bowls to find the noodles were literally congealed together as one big brick- the extra noodles on the side literally wouldn\u2019t come apart, they had all merged into super noodle brick (see pics). After trying to unstick with a bit of broth, then oil, those all went right into the trash. The noodles with toppings (aka standard noodles for your order) were a little more forgiving, but literally needed to be soaked in hot broth and picked apart to separate. On top of it, the pork belly was all fatty over cooked nastiness\u2026 the dumplings were cold, and the broth tasted like vegetable broth. Not even as flavorful as chicken brother, just straight up unsalted bean juice. A bit of eel sauce, soy sauce, siracha, umami powder and real chicken broth got mine to be edible ish, but half of my friends in on the order just gave up and made an oven pizza that night.\n\nBeyond disappointing experience for everyone except my dog, who did rejoice in the fact that we all fed her the nasty pork belly that came floating in our sad soup (see pics for manic happy dog post pork belly).", "date": 1637089345, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107976476251123077566/reviews"}, {"ID": 838, "rating": 5, "comment": "The food here is really kind of the star of the shelf for somebody that's not in Ohio buckeye fan anyway...

I noticed not one order has been given to a customer and the line is getting longer. A female employee comes from the bathroom and reports a catastrophic scene of filth. It is a full 13 minutes before I see one bag given to a customer as I listen to a customer in the drive-thru asking about the wait. I was really hungry and waited 26 minutes for a burger ( yes, one single burger). This gave me time to notice that all of the tables in the restaurant were soiled with leftover ketchup Mayo etc. During this entire episode I witnessed three customers served. In the distance there was a basket of cooked fries it was still there when I left.

My husband suggested it as a way to get me out of the house.  Mexican is an easy way to do that.  We walked a few blocks to El Pulpo Loco in quite cold weather.  It was well worth it.  I am not  crazy about having drinks during the week, but after tasting my husband\u2019s margarita, I had to have one, but with a salted rim.  It was the perfect compliment to our meal, which consisted of Shrimp Empanadas, Steak Burrito (for me), and Steak and Shrimp fajitas for my husband.  Of course, we had the guacamole.  It was really good.  I like my guacamole a little chunky, as opposed to looking like something akin to mashed potatoes, and El Pulpo\u2019s guacamole was perfect.\n\nOne thing I loved about the burrito is that I could eat it with my hands, as opposed to a fork.  It was stuffed with steak, beans, cheese, sour cream, onions, and cilantro, but I could pick it up and eat it without a fork.  It was huge, so much so, that the other half will be my lunch tomorrow.  I tasted the veggies in my husband\u2019s fajita and liked them.  Nicely seasoned and the vegetables were not overly cooked; they still had a nice crunch.\n\nThe service was great as well.

It's as home-style authentic as it gets. While this place is delivering 5-stars across the board - ambiance, food, and service.\n\nAmbiance\nIt's perfect. The rustic home-style feel of SVK is not just imitated, but authentic. Every item seems to have a backstory around it - from the tung oil rubbed wooden fixtures to the chachkies on the wall. You can even read about the history of many of them by paging through the beautifully designed 'newspaper' which sites on each table. The light fixtures are cleverly converted antique kitchen gadgets and pans. It's a cozy, beautiful space. The tables are quite close together, so getting in and out of the seats along the wall might take a little bit of a shuffle. Music was a comfortable level. The seats along the front window have several outlets, making it a great place to plug in if you plan to sit and do some work. Wi-Fi is also available.\n\nFood\nI have been waiting to try SVK's food and, even on opening day, they did not disappoint. I stopped by for both breakfast and lunch. Expect to spend $10-$20 for a meal with a side and a drink.\n- Cold brew - SVK uses Metropolis coffee and I'm happy to report that they didn't skimp on the cold brew. It's strong and bold and you can taste the coffee. Exactly what you hope for in a cold brew. Size (16 oz) was very reasonable as well\n- Winnemac Bagel - What a fresh experience! It is open face, bagel with some really amazing ingredients. The tomato, lettuce, and seasoning really came together. Not a grab a go sandwich, but if you can spare a few moments I'd recommend it\n- Salsa w/ house made chips - The crunch on these was notable before I even tasted the salsa. SNAP! Salted, but not overly so. The salsa was delicious as it was surprisingly, but pleasantly, sweet before the heat from the medium salsa kicks in\n- Shrimp Taco w/ citrus slaw - 3 tacos packed w/ shrimp, which is nice. They don't shortchange you. The citrus slaw also delivers big flavor. They serve it with salsa, but I think there would almost be too much going on, so I opted to keep it on the side. Tacos are of modest size, especially if you didn't get anything else. [Update: now served with 3 tacos, up from 2, which makes it more of a meal]\n- Rice pudding - Just-right level of sweetness and cinnamon served in a convenient personal sized tin. This with a scoop of ice cream would be an amazing dessert to split [Update: no longer available]\n- Bobtail ice cream - I had one scoop of the cookie dough and it was a very rich treat. I have not had Bobtail before. It's quite a soft ice cream. More like a custard than traditional ice cream. The cookie dough was a little limited on cookie dough and was more like vanilla w/ chocolate chunks. However, the flavor was good and with eight flavors to pick from, I'm sure there is something you'll enjoy. [Update: Bobtail sold to Johnson's Real Ice Cream; I've tried several flavors and they are quite good].\n- Rest of offering - The menu is rounded out with a mixture of pastries, fresh meals, soups, sides, and beverage options. A few bagged sweets are also on offer but they are tucked away on side of register.\n\nService\nA local place run by locals, so service is super friendly and the owners are very involved in both front and back of house. When I sat down for lunch, the food was brought out quickly and they offered to clear the spot when I was done eating. Water is self-serve from a cooler, by the well-stocked coffee bar. Tables were quickly cleaned and reset for the next customers. There are railroad spikes on the walls to hang bags and coats. If you want to use the restroom, you'll need to ask as it requires a walk through the kitchen to get to it. Food is made to order - plan for at least 10 minutes to get your food or call ahead to order for grab-and-go.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experiences at SVK and wish them the best of luck. They are a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to spending more here in the future!\n\n[Updated Jan 2020 to reflect my many visits since SVK opened]", "date": 1579283414, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109188198577782638837/reviews"}, {"ID": 1365, "rating": 5, "comment": "An amazing comprehensive Italian experience with a wide selection of Italian food, wine, cheese, meat and other culinary elements.

You get views of both river and the three major skyscrapers: Trump Tower, John Hancock and the Sears Tower (there was never a name change for us locals). I must tell you that it is so beautiful to look at.  In fact, I'm trying to get the bar to put my name on that table but that is not going well.

I wanted to tell the guy that he was sitting in the best table and that it was a \"NO WORK ZONE\". Look at the view and work later!\n\nThere are also daily specials during the week from Sunday to Thursday. Give them a call to find out exactly. I believe that Thursday is $6 flavored vodka night with any mixer night. There's a special Bloody Mary on Sundays.\n\nSo if you're in the mood for a different view and not your typical tourist trap, then this is the place.

I had the skillet and my friend had the boneless wings (half buffalo and half sweet and sour). The wings were fried nicely. The coating was crunchy. The sauce, however, was another thing.

THEN, with maybe a few sips left in our wine glasses our server said we had to get up and the next party was there to sit down. It was a SHOCK when we saw only one of the next fourtop was there and could have easily waited another three minutes for us to enjoy our last sips - the restaurant was only about half full too.

The salad was the perfect blend of mozzarella, tomato, salad, and olive oil that formed a union of flavors for a salad unlike no other. The salad was one of the simplest but best I've had in a while. Now the main course was just beyond what I expected. The perfect blend of soft pasta layers, sticky and savory meats coupled with crimson scrumptious red sauce and topped with fantastic melted cheese bring you straight to flavor town. The tastes, textures, and smells all combine to make the best Italian food I have ever eaten and the best dining experience in a few years. 10/10 would recommend to anyone wanting Italian.

There's about 10 tables both inside and outside, but it was a rainy day so opted for the inside.  They don't sell individual slices, but the small 10\" pizza is only 4 reasonable slices.  Service was very fast and friendly.\n\nOrdered the 10\" Capricciosa pizza which took about 10-15 minutes to arrive.  Pizza was straight out the oven and looked great.  Crust was a good thickness, crispy, just the right amount of sauce, and there was a generous amount of ingredients.  They also have desserts such as gelato, tiramisu, cannolis, and cookies.

Not sure if his son is getting lower quality meats and other things but it\u2019s not as tasty as it used to be. Other than that I would highly recommend you stop by and eat!

So we stopped by on a Sunday night to get our fix.\nWe have had Polish food both in the states and in Europe, to us, this place represents the true meaning of Polish comfort food.  It is far from gourmet because it is not meant to be, simple ingredients and simple taste with great value.  And yes some of the dishes can be made easily with a microwave, but that is not the point of eating out no?\nThe food came quickly given it wasn\u2019t busy, the sausages with onions were great and the potato pancakes were simply exceptional, I would have to say it is probably the best that I have ever tasted.  The beef stew was ok, tender beef, especially love the dumplings.  The stuffed cabbage was great, the rice and meat was cooked just right, and the sauce compliments. The schnitzel was the most tender I have tried and it was fried to perfection.  However I was hoping there is a bit more flavor in the meat.\nOver all, great place, good service, great value will surely come back for the pierogi and the duck!", "date": 1636336882, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114187871045557704407/reviews"}, {"ID": 2052, "rating": 3, "comment": "The Food especially the Valentines Meal with the Duck was really delicious!

For SO MANY YEARS, dating back to 2003, the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich by Panera Bread was my daily delicious nourishment! Sometime around 2009, I stopped eating this sandwich cold turkey (for no specific reason) and have craved it not ever since... until recently. The free one-month unlimited coffee by Panera lured me into their bakery last month. And the little ordering touch screens lured me to see if my delicious sandwich still existed. AND YES. IT DOES. So for the past couple of days when fetching my coffee, I've been tempted to see if I can easily build my own version of the sandwich (no feta, extra peppadew, extra cucumber, extra red onions, no emerald greens, add spinach), and oh my gosh it played out perfectly! In the olden days, relying on a human for my many special requests was always risky. The little ordering tablets ensured that I could have it my way. The only difference between my old school sandwich and now is that I no longer eat dairy (that started in 2010 hence the no feta request)... and the sandwich would absolutely be incomplete without a cheeselike addendum; but Panera already resolved that issue because the sandwich now comes with hummus! So I ordered extra! AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS! It was a perfect experience from ordering to receiving to eating. My head was on cloud nine. This bakery did a phenomenal job. In fact, I have since ordered this sandwich six more times in the past week! I am in love. Thank you so much for the careful time that your bakery invests into being kind to the customers and to executing a perfect sandwich construction!

Explained to (Alex) that my wife found a piece of glass in her drink. We did not get any type of explanation.  At this point my wife was very upset. We drove 1 1/2 hrs to this establishment and was very hungry.  Not one time did they offer any type of complimentary discount. My wife was very skeptical about eating her meal after this. I was already hungry and had not eaten since about 11 am that day, so I ate my food. I told them to pack my wife food to go and we left without tipping. The good thing about this matter was I Groupon the restaurant for the meal so I didn't pay full price for the meal. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

While I usually post on Yelp or TripAdvisor, I wanted to post this review to Google so more people are aware of the poor experience we had.\n\nTonight we went to Leona's for dinner because my wife was interested in their gluten free pizza. I will say, she loved it her pizza. It had pepperoni and bacon on it and she said the crust tasted different than most GF pizza which made it have delicious flavor. She also had a long island ice tea which she said tasted good.\n\nOn the other hand, my experience was very poor. Our server, even the manager had a tendency to drop off stuff at our table and then walk away quickly so they couldn't hear us asking for what we needed. Leaving us sitting and staring at our food for 10 minutes unable to eat ir. After we received our food we had catch a manager passing by to get us cutlery so we could eat.\n\nI ordered the garlic chicken with side salad and fettuccine alfredo and a lemonade to drink. Oh, where to begin. The garlic chicken was bland and very dry. It didn't have any flavor like promised on the menu. It needs to have sauce with it or on it or they need to do a better job with the breading. The side salad was not fresh and didn't come with dressing. The fettuccine alfredo had a bland flavor-no seasoning, and has serious room for improvement. The lemonade was what you can find at the grocery store for cheap, yet cost $3 because they put sugar around the rim to make it fancy. I really wanted a refill to help me eat the severely dry chicken, but our server was busy with other tables.\n\nI was starving so I ate the fettuccine and some of the chicken, but that was all. My meal cost $15 but that is a rip off considering you get better quality and better tasting chicken at Popeye's for $5. I refused to pay for the food I didn't eat, explained to the manager how bad the food tasted and how dissatisfied I was. The manager seemed more interested in defending the food than hearing my explanation as to why it didn't taste good, which in my opinion means he has no idea what good customer service is. We placed our money on the table and left.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of other Italian restaurants where you can get a $15 chicken dinner that tastes much better than crap they serve at Leona's.\n\nSince my wife enjoyed her pizza I will give them a star, but I feel that 1 star is even generous considering the poor service and poor tasting food I had. She may return for the pizza, but I will not be returning.\n\nI also share with everyone I know both the positive and negative experiences I have at restaurants.

It just didn\u2019t work to have a whole plate of cauliflower to eat at the very end of the meal after having eaten the more heavy dishes already. We also got a plate of green beans on the house because of the long waiting time (appreciated the gesture) - also arrived at the end of our meal, but like with the cauliflowers, it felt like eating side dishes after already having finished the \u201cmain meal\u201d which just didn\u2019t work for us.\n- The 6 dishes we tried simply didn\u2019t live up to our expectations and certainly not to all the hype. Yes, everything was delicious and there were some nice creative flavor combinations, but nothing that really wowed us at all. And a big minus that the $16 sourdough bread was burnt and very dry.

I think the problem is they have too many items on the menu. Why would I come to a Chinese place to get myself Pho, Ramen, or any Korean or Thai cuisine? They may have some excellent chefs who can cook everything here but believe me, no one makes sushi better than a Japanese sushi chef. Quality is always over quantity. First of all, the bubble milk tea was over average as the Oolong and the green tea they were using are high quality, I think. However, the tapioca pearl itself was disappointing as it is tough, and not sweet. The Matcha drink and Avocado Custard Pudding Freeze were tasteless and terrible, respectively. There must be some other places in Chicago serving better tapioca milk tea. Second of all, the cane shrimp turned out pretty delicious. It was not too sweet as I was worried but tasty. The food was served five to eight minutes after ordering. Third of all, the noodle soup here was horrible. I have always kept in mind that the Chinese have great noodle soup. Thus, we ordered Free Range Chicken Noodle and Fishball Egg Noodle Soup. The broth is literally, definitely poor, bland, or no taste at all. No savory, no salty, no sweet, nothing, plain just like the boiling water of everything existing in the bowl. I was sure that the egg noodle is the noodle that is made with egg and wheat, yet the one we got was confusingly white and clear just like the white rice noodle.

The food and service are impeccable, and I always find myself itching to go back. Although, before I dive into how much I love this place, the atmosphere does leave a bit to be desired. The table and chairs are no frills, and there is a HUGE old-school big screen TV in the middle of the dining room. This was surprising to me as it looks like a quaint little restaurant from the outside, but it has a conflicting vibe of restaurant and hole in the wall taqueria. Although, once you taste the food all of this atmosphere business just seems to disappear. As for the food, here are a few highlights: 1) BYOB with no corkage fee: Feel free to bring in your bottles of wine or growlers of beer, the waitresses will happily bring out the correct glass for your beverage of choice. 2) Guacamole: A heaping portion of freshly prepared guacamole. You can taste all of the individual flavors of the guacamole (avocado, onion, cilantro) which team together for an incredible explosion of deliciousness. I'm a guacamole fiend, and their's is one of my favorites. 3) Complimentary Chips & Salsa: They serve up a very spicy chipotle salsa and a fresh pico de gallo with their housemade chips that are both light and dense at the same time. I find myself mixing the salsas on the chips to balance the spiciness, but they are both great on their own. 4) Chipotle Carne Asada: This dish is top notch in both flavor and presentation! The portion size is large, meaning you get three decently sized pieces of steak nestled in a chipotle sauce and topped off with cheese.The sides on this dish were surprising, ranging from pureed black beans to a few sprigs of asparagus, which I feel that you don't see too often. The meat was incredibly tender and juicy and was properly trimmed, so you weren't \"bothered\" by an gristle, just a succulent steak. You can either eat this dish as is, or make up your own little taco in the corn tortillas they provide.. 5) Enchilada Special: Four enchiladas (your choice of steak or chicken) topped with the same chipotle sauce as the Carne Asada dish topped with queso fresco cheese sour cream, avocado slices, and corn. I wouldn't recommend the chicken as it was a little dry, but the steak is fantastic here! The presentation was beautiful on this dish as well, and the flavor followed suit. I love the service here, as it is run by three women who were the waitresses, busing the tables, washing the dishes, and preparing the food. They all trade off on the duties, so you end up having all three visit your table at some point, which is a great touch. I adore this establishment and I'll continue coming back!", "date": 1442936895, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116561979655096643856/reviews"}, {"ID": 2606, "rating": 4, "comment": "This is a great little place to stop and pick something up on the way home from the train.

The food is good but nothing extraordinary when you consider being able to get fresh, also very good Mexican food for half the price elsewhere in Chicago.  However, I don't know too many places that serve Ecuadorian food so I am still glad that I tried this restaurant.\n\nThey give you complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa is pretty spicy so be careful.  I love spicy food so I was very happy.  The service was okay.  I liked that the server asked if we wanted ice or non-iced water since my husband prefers his water without ice.\n\nWe ordered the cheese empanada, beef stew, strip steak, and a side of sweet plantains.  The portions were pretty large.  The beef stew and cheese empanada were just meh. Next time I'll order the beef empanada instead.  The strip steak was pretty delicious.  It came with these potatoes in a peanut sauce...amazing!  The plantains were good but overpriced for the portion ($2.80 for about 3/4 of a banana).  I also didn't like that the restaurant cut the plantain into pieces before cooking it.  It made parts of the sweet plantain very dry.  I'm used to getting a whole intact piece of banana so this was different.\n\nOur water was not refilled at all during our meal.  I guess they expect you to do that yourself (since they drop a pitcher of water on the table at the beginning).\n\nIn overall, I wasn't particularly wow'd by the experience but I still think the food is decent and it's one of the few places you can get Ecuadorian food in the city.", "date": 1386174765, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110977799509975356450/reviews"}, {"ID": 2608, "rating": 4, "comment": "The nachos and tacos were good.

After being sat and clearly waiting rest of my guests I was not offered anything to drink aside from water that was already on the table. I had to get up and ask the manager for wine. After that, my server was constantly bothering me for updates - clearly no understanding of social queues. Once my friends and I were all enjoying wine we were told we only had an hour left at the table (mind you, the restaurant was empty aside from us). But we get it, Friday night and a small restaurant so we ordered quickly. Once complete, they rushed the check and wouldn't even let us split evenly three ways (annoying). THEN, with maybe a few sips left in our wine glasses our server said we had to get up and the next party was there to sit down. It was a SHOCK when we saw only one of the next fourtop was there and could have easily waited another three minutes for us to enjoy our last sips - the restaurant was only about half full too.

I judge a place by how they cook a steak.  Carson's is top notch.

This was the latter.\nPrime Rib - This was a cut that had no qualms about being the best.  It was juicy, cooked to perfection and good god tasty.\nSalt and Pepper Crusted Potato - If there was a fail this was it.  The failure was the potato wasn't cooked fully.  It was great when it came out but as the dining went on it cooled and the flaw showed.  If I had to make a suggestion, it would be to use a smaller potato or do an oven smash. (Carson's if you are reading this feel free to reach out and I'll explain it to you)\nMy wife had the Key Lime Pie and her being from Key West she actually said that she would bring this down to KW.  That is a huge compliment.\nWhat made up for the potato for me was the specially made dessert.  The brownie dessert that sounded so good was a boy (It has nuts) so they gave me ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce.

The store was mostly empty when I arrived. I got a Buffalo chicken calzone and a green protein salad with honey dijon dressing. Even though I appeared to be the only one to order, it still took 15-20 mins for my order to arrive. This is likely because they were cooking my calzone. It was nice however that when it arrived, it was served to my table. The calzone was a good portion size and looked fresh. The bread had a nice exterior crunch with a soft interior. The filling inside was really hot and definitely would require some time to cool off. The flavor was alright. The cheese had a nice melt and the meat was soft. The buffalo flavoring was good as well, not too spicy, but my main problem was with how hot it was, making it difficult to fully enjoy. Otherwise it was a delicious and filling calzone. The ranch dressing they provided worked as a nice condiment for the calzone. The salad was plentiful and fresh. The honey dijon dressing also had a nice taste. The salad came with a side of bread (the same used in the calzone). It was warm and tasted great as well.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience and value. For $10, the calzone felt worth it. The restaurant was clean and ambient. The cashier who assisted me was also very nice and courteous. She even gave me a student discount that I didn't even know I had! My only complaints would be the somewhat long wait time, even when it was mostly empty, and the hotness of the calzone on the inside. Finally, I wish they provided some more durable utensils; the plastic fork and knife were way too flimsy to cut up my calzone. I ended up eating it with my hands like a burrito.

We didn't go as often as we would like because service was always very slow.

After all of these years, the flavor of the food has not changed but the quality has gone down hill for sure.  We came on a Saturday night and there was no one here.  I think partially because of the COVID protocol (vaccine card check, and yes get your shots), partially because of the same old boring menu and partially because of the food quality.  The meats are definitely on the drier side, like others mentioned, reheated.  My whole rack of St Louis ribs shrink down to 60% of its original size.  I can understand COVID has caused a lot of issues for many people but cutting these corners will simply make things worse in my opinion.  One thing I just found out, they started charging for the chips and the pickles that was given out for free, $3 each and no refills.  Seriously, pretty soon they will start charging for toilet paper, nakins and take home boxes.

I'm often wary myself about a restaurant serving two really different cuisines (Ethiopian and Chinese), but the Ethiopian is delicious. I didn't try the Chinese, so I can't comment.\n\nI spoke with one of the owners who works weekends, Dobaro, and I encouraged him to stick with the Ethiopian, although I imagine Chinese would sell better. In any case, he told me that it's surprisingly hard to find a Chinese chef. When they do get one, then I would say it's good for Chinese as well. But Ethiopian food is generally better than Chinese anyway!\n\nSo the food is awesome, and Dobaro is even more awesome. I think another big sell for this place is probably that it delivers! I don't know of any other Ethiopian places that deliver. Also, this isn't important to me, but this place is Halal! They buy their meat from a Halal butcher on Devon.

Food and pics were great and then there was a shift change. Our second server never came to introduce herself. We caught her in passing to order drinks as she was rushing outside to tend the customer with the dog. We waited as she brought the dog food, played with the dog and then started playing in her hair. I asked if she could bring us ice for the water but also if she could wash her hands first because I had a dog allergy and saw her playing with the dog and in her hair. She stared at us and said sure but she never came back to the table.  We received the drinks from the bartender and she was a good time as well. We caught the second server in passing the second time she went to rush to the customer with the dog and we requested the bill. The server brought the bill and I requested a paper copy of the receipt. I never saw the server again. No receipt no nothing. I don't remember if she said thank you. This would have been an awesome experience but the server with the jean shorts and tan/  brown shirt was terrible.

We have been patrons to this restaurant on and off for over 10 years, we don\u2019t go very often but this is really the only place in town that serves authentic Japanese with a full menu, and not one of those fusion sushi wannabe ramen places around town.  The reason we don\u2019t go very often is because the service is very unpredictable, I would say 50/50 you will get prompt service and the other half, you could wait 15 to 20 minutes just standing there with a reservation and the restaurant only at 80% occupancy.  You could also wait at least 30-40 minutes for your appetizer and another 30 for on trays.  In other words, easily a two hour meal where 80% of that is just waiting.  There are 2 servers, 1 sushi chef, 1 busboy, and this guy who answers the phone sometimes and spends a long time chatting with patrons but does nothing else.   This is on a weekend.  So what we figured out after all of these years, is don\u2019t go during the weekend if you don\u2019t have the time to waste, if the restaurant is busy, look at the number of order tickets at the sushi bar and how many tables have been served, you need to order the right combination of dishes in order to get them faster.  Sushi is fast, but not when there are 10-15 tickets ahead of you.\nThe price is downtown price, more than the burbs for sure.  The quality of the food is Ok, compare to the same type of restaurant in Japan, they will get about 3 stars only but for the US, 4 star is good.  Most of the dishes to me are a little under flavored, especially the  nagasaki champon and Curry, the Sukiyaki is one pot style, so you cannot really choose what to eat when and how well to cook each item.  But at least it is better than the pre-cooked style over rice.  I still prefer the traditional way better, not many places in the US has that now.   I would recommend this place if you are downtown since this is it anyway and you have not spent any extensive amount of time in Japan, because if you have, it would make you miss visiting Japanese even more.", "date": 1634437923, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114187871045557704407/reviews"}, {"ID": 3302, "rating": 5, "comment": "Wow. First of all, this is one of the very few Japanese places in town that offer a full Japanese dinner menu, and not just Sushi -which by the way was spectacular so its worth a visit if you're only having Sushi. A big part of why the rolls tasted so good was the sublime room temperature they came at, instead of the cold cuts we used to get at other places. I had never had a Japanese curry before, and was blown away with my dish today. My wife had the Unaju which was pretty much the best I had ever tasted, with melt-in-your-mouth eel on rice. We had the Salmon skin Maki that was so good we regretted not ending our meal with it, same goes for the incredible Uni which was the creamiest we've ever had. For the dessert, my wife love dher green tea ice cream which was a very generous portion, but I feel that my green tea cheesecake was a step up in flavor so I'd recommend that instead. Service was perfect and prompt, with very friendly and considerate servers. Overall we had a blast and I don't think there's any reason to have Japanese anywhere else in the city.

Then we headed back down to the street to go next door to the rock joint to watch the concert we came to see, the band Living Colour. Great sound, easy views of the stage. There's a balcony area with some seating as well. I really dig all of the band and other random stickers that are all over almost every available surface in the joint and the rock club, especially the bathrooms. Very rock n' roll!

I did not know you could make a reservation by phone, still, we got a seat shortly after arriving. The first thing I noticed was the countless pictures and autographed sports memorabilia proudly displayed throughout the restaurant. As a fan of the Bulls, it was captivating to see so much history and familiar names, such as Steve Kerr and Luc Longley. Cubs fans will appreciate it tenfold as there were even more Cubs players gracing their walls. I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nOur waitress, who I believe was also a co-owner, took our drink order first. I got a Japanese white peach cocktail and my wife ordered a sweet Japanese plum wine. The cocktail was refreshing and subtle, and the wine was sweet like candy but still tasted great. After the drinks, we ordered food and got the pajun as our appetizer (Korean seafood pancake). For our mains, we ordered the hone kalbi, bulkogi, and Japanese sausage.\n\nFirst was the pajun, a generous portion of food that could be shared among four people. It was light, fluffy, salty, and felt like it came straight off the heat with its freshness. On top of that, it had added texture from the squid, beef, and crunchy onions. The squid felt chewy, but everything else hit the mark. Once we finished the pajun, the staff prepared the grill at our table, and instead of a gas grill, we used a wood/charcoal grill to my delight! The banchan (Korean sides) shortly followed, and the meats. We were all set to start cooking and digging in!\n\nBoth the hone kalbi and the bulkogi were unbelievably tender. The bulkogi dipped into the sauce provided for us was a perfect sweet and salty bite. Mixed into the side of rice only made each bite feel more heavenly! The hone kalbi tasted of high quality yet was chewier than the bulkogi. The flavor was as great as the bulkogi, but it did not have the melt-in-your-mouth characteristic of the bulkogi. For my money, I would have ordered another bulkogi rather than the hone kalbi. As for the Japanese sausage, they were basically cocktail wieners and tasted fine; nothing that blew our minds. Between bites of meat, I tried each side, and they were all delicious. My two favorites were the kimchi and potato salad, which tasted made-in-house. If we had enough room, we would have asked for the wagyu beef menu they have available, but we were close to exploding by the end to try their wagyu. We saved it for next time!\n\nChicago Kalbi is a restaurant that's great and knows it. It does not need a flashy sign or marketing to flaunt itself and has trusted its food, service, and word-of-mouth to stay in business for decades. My wife and I were lucky enough to get a table at this packed hidden gem, and I join the fray of people that chant their greatness.

It may be easy to pass up with it's lack luster presence, but if you have a little extra time, you'll get a quality meal that's fresh, flavorful, and inexpensive.\n\nI eagerly awaited the opening of Arami Go! late last year as it looked like it was going to be an express sushi place, while currently the only place I get sushi from in Streeterville is Niu Japanese Fusion Lounge, which is a little too classy for a quick bite, but Arami Go! is not a sushi place.\n\nMy first time here I got the lemongrass chicken ramen. It sounded so good, but I was really disappointed. The broth tasted like chicken stock, there was no hint of lemon, and it was filled with ingredients, but all of them flavorless. The chicken was juicy with broth, but tasted like just that, chicken broth. The best thing in the whole giant Styrofoam cup was the fish cakes. Though, I had to give this place a second try after tasting my boyfriend's short ribs.\n\nGet the bento box. I recommend both the short ribs and the pork belly as the protein (probably not the healthiest choices, but defiantly the tastiest). You then pick out what to fill the rest of the compartments with from a choice of starch (the lemony fresh soba noodles are bomb), vegetable or spicy tofu salad (they're all good, but I can't stray away from the marinated brussel sprouts with the flaky bonito topping...drool), and a palate cleanser (basically edamame with different salting profiles). You also, by default now, get some lovely pickled vegetables to cut up your small dishes.\n\nThe inside has seating for about 25 people, and you approach a long walk-up counter along a narrow bland hallway, which tells you it has an express flow to it. Unfortunately every time I come here, I end up taking a seat at one of the empty tables for 5-10 minutes while waiting for my takeout bento box.\n\nIf you don't know what you're getting into, it's difficult to figure out what this place is and what you're supposed to order. Upon getting to the register, you feel a little more at ease talking to the staff. They talk about the food like they really take pride in it, and they walk you through all your options, but this seems like an unnecessary task.\n\nThe atmosphere is empty and has no personality. I used to think they just opened prematurely and just hadn't got to decorating, but nothing has changed and it's been a few months. They may have been going for a tranquil, cleanly feel... but it just feels temporary (they could at least use some instructional signage or photos). I want them to stay around, but I live in a residential building just down the street and I have never seen any kind of advertising from them. Hopefully they do well during lunch or for delivery, because there are a lot of new quick and inexpensive food options opening fast in the neighborhood and I would hate to see them forgotten.\n\nPlease try it!

It is really good food.  The Google directions to get there are horrid.  I parked to eat at Aria about 30 minutes before my reservation and was 15 minutes late.  Aria is in the Fairmont hotel, and it was pretty much dumb luck that I ended up finding the place.  Once I got there, they were closing up from the lunch service but seated me anyway.  The place is very flashy yet elegant.  The first thing you'd probably notice would be the marble tables with peach accents.  The person who designed this place wasn't afraid of color and shows it with the vibrant black and red carpet up to the red overhead lights contrasting from the dark brown curtains.  The decor definitely fits with that Asian mindset and I must say I was reminded of my travels to Hong Kong by the warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe Thai Ginger Kitana, immediately jumped out at me from the cocktail menu.  The drink was one of those dangerous types where the presence of alcohol goes completely undetected.  All you get is the tangy taste of sweetness combining with fresh lime juice and a little spice from the ginger.  Think of it as a limeade with a little bit of a kick.  The naan, is the bread offering there.  The naan is some of the best I've had and a welcomed change from the normal bread and butter that you normally get before a meal.  The naan stands up on it's own but it would be foolish to pass on the four tasty accompaniments.  The spicy spicy tomato chutney was my favorite, followed by the curry lentil.   The spinach and yogurt sauces were also good but not as memorable.\n\nThe beet salad scored extra points for presentation, displaying the bright colors of the beet are easily noticeable   The sweet beets go well with the spicy arugula.  The candied walnuts at sweetness and crunch and the tangy vinaigrette. Next up was the short ribs.  In this dish the star of the show was the greens. They were tender but not cooked to death, had a porky taste to them that reminds me of the greens I enjoyed in my childhood (and still do today).  The subtle soy flavor in the background added something that made these greens probably some of the best that I've ever tasted.  For me, the greens stole the show, which is a pretty tough feat to accomplish considering how good the perfectly cooked and shaped little spheres of potato were.  Not to mention how aggressively seasoned, yet tender the short ribs were.\n\nFor desert, I was served a platter of truffles.  One garnished with sesame that was made with dark chocolate  that was so decadent that you could feel the richness of it before it hit your palate.  The other dark chocolate truffle had a rich fruit flavor to it.  My favorite had notes of coffee cinnamon and you guessed it caramel with milk chocolate.  The only truffle I didn't care for was the white chocolate which was overwhelmingly sweet and tasted like a Hershey's cookies and cream bar minus the cookies.  It was the only thing of the day that completely failed for me.", "date": 1382149329, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106686522921122471770/reviews"}, {"ID": 3848, "rating": 1, "comment": "Not great given the price.

And an order of six chicken wings, she asked me what kind of wings, I said buffalo). I paid. She did not ask me if I wanted my receipt nor did she hand over my fountain cup drink after I PAID for my combo meal and wings. I waited to the side for my food, and she took more customers' orders at the register. I heard her ask the other customers \"Would you like your receipt?\" They said no, and then she handed over their fountain cup drinks (even though they didn't ask for their cups) \u2013 she just randomly handed them their fountain cup drinks. Apparently she picks and chooses to which customers she wants to hand over the fountain cup drinks right away. Very unprofessional of her. Once my food was all set on the tray, I went to go sit down at a table. I noticed that my buffalo chicken wings didn't come with a dipping sauce. So I walked over to the register and told the young lady that they forgot to put a dip sauce, on my tray, for my chicken wings.

Then the sandwich had more mustard and bread than anything. Wth? Barely any meat!!! And the $1.50 I spent for the cheese was like half a slice.who does this? Anywho I will never come back and make sure my peeps dont either. Terrible food and terrible service. I will stick with Stony sub where $10 gets you the sandwhich with cheese fries and and a soda.

After making *sure* they were, in fact, open, I parked my car and stepped inside.\n\nIt's fairly small with a fast food/walk up counter vibe so I wasn't sure what to expect but nothing ventured, nothing gained, so I ordered my usual: crab rangoon and szechuan chicken. Since white rice was the only option with my meal, I also requested a small order of chicken fried rice. Oh, and I had one can of coke.\n\nWithin minutes, my rangoons appeared, deliciously hot, crispy, and full of flavour. A short while later, after asking if I was ready, my main course came out. It. Was. Huge!! And really good! The sauce with the chicken was a little thicker than I like but it still tasted good. The fried rice was perfect.\n\nI was only able to eat 1/4 of what I'd ordered!

After driving around in circles for what seemed like days, my friend and I finally spotted this Roly Poly which was tucked away in the side of a building down a narrow alley. We thought we were going mad looking for the address, but were relieved to find it. So in a state of frustration and Groupon in hand, we made our way in.\n\nNot surprised, the place was empty like a total ghost town. I didn't mind though; no lines for us! We made our way in the counter and I noticed that the place is waaay understaffed granted I don't think people are coming in flocks because the location is so hidden - there was about one cook and one cashier and another person standing around. The Groupon iss such an amazing deal - you get 5 full sandwiches with five sides, which consist of chips, cookie, potato salad or pasta salad, as well as your choice of drink (fountain drinks or bottled).\n\nThe menu is HUGE so make sure you look at it online before you come in. We chose to try the pesto chicken, buffalo slim, key west cuban, oriental chicken, and chipotle chicken sandwiches. The standout was definitely the pesto chicken sandwich with large chunks of chicken, provolone cheese, mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes. The other sandwiches were alright. Avoid the oriental chicken sandwich - super watery and bland.\n\nFor the sides, we chose potato salad. In hindsight, we should've just chosen cookies and chips because the mustard in the mayo based sauce was too overpowering. As we were dining, there were loads of people coming in and it got a bit hectic so they should defs hire more people to man the front of house. Other than that, there's parking, but it's tricky cause it's downtown and there's free wifi as well! Am I rushing to go back - NO.

After driving around in circles for what seemed like days, my friend and I finally spotted this Roly Poly which was tucked away in the side of a building down a narrow alley. We thought we were going mad looking for the address, but were relieved to find it. So in a state of frustration and Groupon in hand, we made our way in.\n\nNot surprised, the place was empty like a total ghost town. I didn't mind though; no lines for us! We made our way in the counter and I noticed that the place is waaay understaffed granted I don't think people are coming in flocks because the location is so hidden - there was about one cook and one cashier and another person standing around. The Groupon iss such an amazing deal - you get 5 full sandwiches with five sides, which consist of chips, cookie, potato salad or pasta salad, as well as your choice of drink (fountain drinks or bottled).\n\nThe menu is HUGE so make sure you look at it online before you come in. We chose to try the pesto chicken, buffalo slim, key west cuban, oriental chicken, and chipotle chicken sandwiches. The standout was definitely the pesto chicken sandwich with large chunks of chicken, provolone cheese, mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes. The other sandwiches were alright. Avoid the oriental chicken sandwich - super watery and bland.\n\nFor the sides, we chose potato salad. In hindsight, we should've just chosen cookies and chips because the mustard in the mayo based sauce was too overpowering. As we were dining, there were loads of people coming in and it got a bit hectic so they should defs hire more people to man the front of house. Other than that, there's parking, but it's tricky cause it's downtown and there's free wifi as well! Am I rushing to go back - NO. But, if I were to purchase another Groupon, I could see myself going again.

My actual waiter did do this when my second plate arrived.\n\nThe pork bun was not how I expected it to look like. The flavor of the pork could have been better. The other items that went with the pork bun did give it flavor.\n\nThe main dish mostly actually good. The lemon wedges did take the main flavor away on some fish, but it's good to have that there for people who like a little acidity.\n\nThe white rice actually had flavor. That's a plus. I was not able to tell the flavor, but it was certainly different compared to how others places prepare their white rice.\n\nUpon paying, i was given the recipe through a rusty, old box that looks as if it was stolen from American Express (the company logo is on there). That was not too amusing.\n\nOverall, if I could, I give this place 3.5 stars.\n4 stars since it rounds up.\nThe lightening could be improved, especially for someone who's coming in, when outside is very bright.

Ordered a thin crust chicken Tikka pizza and it tastes nothing like that. Just some chicken pieces tasteless with so much cheese, it was not at all thin crust. Ordered shawarma as well. One with rice , one with pita. Chicken was uncooked and it was the same chicken which was served in pizza as well. They served it with no side such as hummus, ganoush. For them shawarma means rice and dry chicken or pita and dry chicken that's all. Shawarma and pizza cannot get worse than this. The lady at the ordering counter mislead me about portion sizes and we ordered more than what would have been sufficient. And shawarma with rice costs extra as well which was not conveyed before ordering.  On top of that they charge 15% surcharge on your orders included by default. I don't mind about price or service if atleast food is good but here food was downright trash.\n\nThis was the only restaurant open in the area, hence I had no choice but after looking and tasting the food we just had to throw everything and go back home with empty stomachs.

Their delivery service was really fast for being at least 3 miles from our location, and their delivery guy actually walked up the three flights of stairs to our apartment instead of waiting at the bottom like most delivery persons (big perk).\n\nFood itself was good. Garlic bread was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and not over cooked or too buttery. Pan-pizza required a fork for the first few bites, but the crust-to-topping ratio was perfect. Enough toppings for flavor, but not so much that the crust couldn't support it.\n\nDecent price, they do have some deals if you call in, tasty pizza, and great delivery. They're added to this apartment's pizza delivery rotation.", "date": 1390187255, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112546727876506045328/reviews"}, {"ID": 4600, "rating": 4, "comment": "Ino's Pizzeria is small pizza and sandwich shop in Edgewater, located in the former GaztroWagon storefront on North Clark Street. The name comes from the middle name of the proprietor, Rene. His middle name is \"Innocente,\" and from that, they get their nifty name.\n\nThe storefront only seats about 10 people, but it is well-kept, and is a decent place to hang out and enjoy a casual meal or to wait while your to-go order is prepared. They have a rather expansive menu, but I've latched-on to their pan pizza. The pan pizza is rather hefty, with a nice crust that is a bit more dense than you'd find at Lou Malnati's, but the pizza is similar to Lou's style. The sauce is on top of the cheese, and the outer crust has a nice, buttery chewiness to it. They don't skimp on the toppings, either. I typically get mine with pepperoni, mushrooms and onions, and the onion chunks are nice and thick - not stringy like you'd find at a chain pizza restaurant. The mushrooms and pepperoni are plentiful, too. The pizza is great hot, but any leftovers also hold up well when re-heated at home.\n\nThe thin crust pizza is a bit more standard fare. I think the crust of the \"thin crust\" is a bit too thick for my tastes, but it is still a decent pie. I think that, if you want to get a pie from Ino's, go for the pan pizza.\n\nIn addition to pizzas, they also have lots of soups, sandwiches, salads, and other items. I've had the philly cheese steak, and it was excellent. Their soups are also quite tasty.\n\nThe service there is very friendly. The staff are always willing to strike-up a conversation and make you feel welcome.

Several people were working frantically behind the bar (it looked like only one poor guy was actually making drinks though  - on Valentine's night). Finally I said something to a bartender/barback and he took our order but it made me anxious to have to sit there for so long and for no one to even speak to us!\n\nI totally understand if you are busy especially on a holiday, but acknowledging customers and explaining that you're busy would be very helpful and help me feel better about paying the higher prices for drinks too.

After grabbing dessert and a coffee at Stan\u2019s Donuts, I walked with said coffee to Bombay for some real food for the first time on this day. While scouring my GPS for a place to eat at Stan\u2019s, I saw Bombay Wraps. On a cold day, a hot meal sounded wonderful. Of all the places detailed in this blog, there hasn\u2019t been an Indian place until know.\n\nIt took about 10 minutes to walk there from Stan\u2019s, due to the traffic and the amount of people out and about. Once I got there, I was surprised to see it mostly empty during lunch time. Maybe I had just missed the rush. Oh well, all the easier for me to order.\n\nThe menu was kind of foreign to me. I knew quite a few of the terms, but that doesn\u2019t mean I knew how they tasted. A few minutes passed of looking over the menu before I had to decide between the chicken tikka and chicken reshmi. In the end, I picked the chicken tikka. The lady cooking it asked if I wanted it spicy. I quickly said \u201cyes\u201d before she could finish her question.\n\nThe way they make it is almost like subway. They have all the ingredients out and make it as you walk towards the cashier. I was given my food before I could get my change from paying.\n\nI grabbed a seat at one of the stools that was along the front wall, so I could look out of the store front as I ate. I noticed my wrap was smaller than I expected but that was fine as I had most of a massive donut a few minutes before.\n\nAs I tried to pick up this soaking and messy wrap, trepidation set in. I was about to taste my first Indian cuisine and I was nervous. Wrap in mouth, I take my first bite\u2026 and am pleasant surprised by how delicious it was. Once I finish the first bite, the spicy kicked in and I took my first sip of the coffee I brought with me. It did nothing to settle the slight burn that was setting in.\n\nWow. I took my time eating the wrap as I was trying to enjoy all the new flavors and tastes I was experiencing. It was delightful. Sadly, the wrap was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. For $5 and change, I was expecting a bit more to the wrap but the quality of what I got couldn\u2019t be beat. Each bite was filled full of flavor and a spicy kick that couldn\u2019t be beat.\n\nAlas, this was my last stop before I resumed some family duties. I was in a hurry to get back to where I needed to be that I forgot to snap a good photo of the inside. It was a bit sparse when it came to decorations but there was plenty of room to handle a lunch/dinner rush.\n\nThis may have been my first Indian cuisine sampling but I doubt it will be my last.", "date": 1655048999, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116253575702283933719/reviews"}, {"ID": 4707, "rating": 5, "comment": "Had a taste for lamb today, so I ordered from Bombay Wraps.

Portions are generous, service is friendly, and as soon as I walked through the doors I knew the smell meant they had the kind of biscuits and gravy that make you need a post breakfast nap. The only thing that could improve this beautiful west side gem is a pie case. Here, I have the Royal Canadian burger, cheese fries, and peach pecan crepes, a great midmorning meal before spending the day running errands.

Now the main course was just beyond what I expected. The perfect blend of soft pasta layers, sticky and savory meats coupled with crimson scrumptious red sauce and topped with fantastic melted cheese bring you straight to flavor town.

It was something that I put in the bucket list. I'm sure every other Burger King has the \"Impossible Burger\" but so far it does taste like a burger but it's not as greasy as a beef burger Whopper. Has the right texture and the right taste of a burger no aftertaste of a vegetable. Do try it but very expensive at just $6 for the sandwich alone versus if you order it with the meal. I'm trying to avoid eating fries and carbonated drinks also ordered a Hershey sundae pie but it doesn't look as nice on my picture then it does on the menu as you see my picture I took. On the other hand, I did taste the Hershey Sunday pie and it was delicious however for such a small portion I was not satisfied. It is like eating a French Silk Pie which is one of my favorite pies to eat next to fruit pies.

Interestingly enough, I had been inside Harry Carey\u2019s the day before as I had taken the Chicago Gangster Crime tour and this restaurant (and the basement safe/hidden passageway) was on the tour as a stop.  Firstly, there is a ton of history in this building.  Loaded with great photos and news clippings.  I could have spent two hours just looking at all that stuff alone.   So over to dinner.  We were greeted immediately at the bar by our bartender.  Ordered our drinks and delivered within minutes.  We were then handed a basket of homemade fresh cut potatoe chips lightly salted by which we devoured.  So yummy.   We shared a 14 oz strip loin steak, a wedge salad and grilled asparagus - served with complimentary buns and butter.   Salad was fresh light and crisp with delicious dressing.  The steak served perfectly (medium) and hot, as were the asparagus.  We were too full for dessert so we took a tiramisu to go - eaten by my hubby who said it was the best he\u2019s ever had with a slight hint of booze (not overpowering). I would highly recommend.  If it wasn\u2019t for the Gangster Crime Tour I would not have even considered this restaurant (I had checked out the menu the day before and all the servers were super friendly and welcoming).

The service and the food stand out. Steven the head waiter takes pride in his work. He is one of the best waiters you will find in Chicago. The fresh baked bread here is amazing. Honestly it is the best bread ever. I have two favorite dishes here: the mussels and the duck. The mussels bowl was loaded with a ton of mussels. I needed more bread to soak up that delicious broth they were cooked in. There is also a great selection of wine to wash it all down. Plus Steven knows his wines and he will direct you in the right direction. The owner is also really friendly. The other day I saw him sweeping in front of his restaurant. I love this old world charm and respect for his business. I have never seen an owner do that in America.

I am new to the neighborhood and I sat outside at a 2top with my 2 year old son.  It took a bit to review the menu and decide so I did not mind the slow service while sitting outside.   It was a challenge to keep my son entertained but the food came and it was great.   The stuffed tomato came with lots of fresh veggies and coleslaw- I opted for tuna salad (chicken, egg, salmon salads were other options).  There was no kids menu online but to my pleasant surprise, there was a kids menu on the menu handed to me.   My son went with the standard chicken nuggets.   I thought $9 was a little expensive for kids meal (no drink) but it was enough food for either 2 kids or 2 meals so we took over half home.\n\nOur meal ended and while we were waiting for the bill and To-go box,  my son became restless so we were up and I was chasing him around and doing my best to keep him out of the way.  I admit this is problematic and apologized to staff/patrons while we waited.   The manager/ owner/ host (older man with shaved head in a loose skirt sleeve button up) had the nerve to say \"get a grip on him\" INSTEAD of bringing a bill or box or doing anything to resolve our issue.\n\nHad I gone to the Bagel without my child or not alone with him,  I would have rate a 4 or 5, but I focus my reviews on dining with children and I likely will not return with kids....

After my recent Cuban romp I got a hankering for Mexican food, something I haven't had in what seems like months. While I was placing my order which consisted is the Pescado (Fish) Soup, Ground Beef Burrito & the California Burrito I had this strange sense of familiarity. Ironically, I did indeed order from this place years ago back when it first opened and decided to shelve my review in-order to give them an opportunity to establish themselves and hopefully improve the food quality (which it drastically needed.) On top of that I placed the exact same order!\n\nHere we are years later and doesn't seem like much has changed. Food arrived about 15 minutes earlier than expected and was piping hot. It's unfortunate that they used cheap everything to pack the food because the soup container pretty much was half open (the lid came off due to it not being able to withstand the heat from the soup) and spilled everywhere in the bag. On top of that when I was pulling out food to see what was leaking, after grabbing the soup container it promptly raised it's hand signaling it was the culprit as it spilled even more soup everywhere, staining the fabric on one of my chairs.\n\nOkay so not a great start...can the food make up for it? The short answer is not in the least. Every burrito has all the fixins' (avocado, lettuce, tomato, sour cream.) All of the meat was over seasoned, a bit too much salt. On top of that the ground beef was overcooked, leading to some very salty crunchy bits within the burrito. Presentation wise things looked good, these were easily some of the neatest packed burritos I've had. They even held up well after taking several bites which shows whoever made them knows how to pack a burrito it's just too bad the quality of everything else isn't great. The fries in the California burrito added nothing and their taste as well as everything else was overpowered by the salty meat. They pretty much just were filler and an excuse to charge more money. I also noticed that the burritos were pretty much 60-70% re-fried beans which for an almost $10 burrito is inexcusable.\n\nThe Pescado soup should've been really easy. It's literally just fish, potatoes & carrots for a basic dish. What I got was a quart of 95% broth with maybe a quarter of a fish, a third of a carrot, a slice of another vegetable and that's it for $12+??? You cannot be serious. The broth tastes like vomit as well and stunk up my apartment really bad. I totally see why they threw in a stack of tortillas with cilantro and onions for free since I ended up taking the fish out of the broth and making fish tacos.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this place. Food is way overpriced and it's obvious they cut corners every chance they get. While the presentation is good, the overall quality of the food ruins everything.\n\n2 out of 5 stars", "date": 1537248007, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317248528922307286/reviews"}, {"ID": 4874, "rating": 3, "comment": "I did an online delivery and added utensils and wasn\u2019t received , an order of French fries and wasn\u2019t received.

This event restaurant space is fun and entertaining if you enjoy cooking or would like to learn how to cook better.  A staff member gives a presentation when everyone is gathered and then has everyone pick a piece of paper out if a bowl to be assigned to a team.  This is a good idea to mix up the party members and not having the men fighting over who will be cooking the meat.  We had three team: appetizers and bread, salad and dessert, and meat and starch.  Each team is assigned a staff chef who explains and helps everyone complete the recipes.  So if someone really doesn't like to cook it would be okay if the other team members pick up the slack.  This did happen at our event but there were others who were happy to pitch in to cover.  Our menu included grilled shrimp with homemade pesto, parmesan cheese puffs, balsamic pear salad, filet mignon with a bordelaise (red wine) sauce, and chocolate flourless cake.  Our team made the appetizers and as soon as we had them prepared we passed them to our coworkers.  Amazingly all of the food prepared was either very good to excellent in taste.

At this point, I was a little annoyed and they accomodated me by saying I could just pay cash for the pop. So okay fine, but they asked if I wanted a can or a six pack - ok, I'll take the six pack. To my shock and horror - a six pack of diet coke was $7. WTH?!?!?! Fine, besides all that - this was the worst pizza I have ever eaten. By the time it got to us it was cold and the cheese was coagulated. The blue cheese dressing that they claim to be famous for is runny and thin and mostly tasteless.

Once my friends and I were all enjoying wine we were told we only had an hour left at the table (mind you, the restaurant was empty aside from us). But we get it, Friday night and a small restaurant so we ordered quickly. Once complete, they rushed the check and wouldn't even let us split evenly three ways (annoying). THEN, with maybe a few sips left in our wine glasses our server said we had to get up and the next party was there to sit down. It was a SHOCK when we saw only one of the next fourtop was there and could have easily waited another three minutes for us to enjoy our last sips - the restaurant was only about half full too.

I think the problem is they have too many items on the menu. Why would I come to a Chinese place to get myself Pho, Ramen, or any Korean or Thai cuisine? They may have some excellent chefs who can cook everything here but believe me, no one makes sushi better than a Japanese sushi chef. Quality is always over quantity. First of all, the bubble milk tea was over average as the Oolong and the green tea they were using are high quality, I think. However, the tapioca pearl itself was disappointing as it is tough, and not sweet. The Matcha drink and Avocado Custard Pudding Freeze were tasteless and terrible, respectively. There must be some other places in Chicago serving better tapioca milk tea. Second of all, the cane shrimp turned out pretty delicious. It was not too sweet as I was worried but tasty. The food was served five to eight minutes after ordering. Third of all, the noodle soup here was horrible. I have always kept in mind that the Chinese have great noodle soup. Thus, we ordered Free Range Chicken Noodle and Fishball Egg Noodle Soup. The broth is literally, definitely poor, bland, or no taste at all. No savory, no salty, no sweet, nothing, plain just like the boiling water of everything existing in the bowl. I was sure that the egg noodle is the noodle that is made with egg and wheat, yet the one we got was confusingly white and clear just like the white rice noodle. The price I paid for two bowls of hot noodle boiling water plus a dish of sugar cane shrimp was $38, not reasonable whatsoever. Probably, the food was better in the past as many of its customers said, though, the food quality of this very moment is destitute.", "date": 1506455803, "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106039788106377602384/reviews"}, {"ID": 5691, "rating": 4, "comment": "Eduardo's has a wonderful atmosphere, very warm and welcoming.

Homemade pasta is amazing and you can't beat their bolognese, but its not worth the absolute annoyingly horrible service we received during our last visit. After being sat and clearly waiting rest of my guests I was not offered anything to drink aside from water that was already on the table. I had to get up and ask the manager for wine. After that, my server was constantly bothering me for updates - clearly no understanding of social queues. Once my friends and I were all enjoying wine we were told we only had an hour left at the table (mind you, the restaurant was empty aside from us). But we get it, Friday night and a small restaurant so we ordered quickly. Once complete, they rushed the check and wouldn't even let us split evenly three ways (annoying). THEN, with maybe a few sips left in our wine glasses our server said we had to get up and the next party was there to sit down. It was a SHOCK when we saw only one of the next fourtop was there and could have easily waited another three minutes for us to enjoy our last sips - the restaurant was only about half full too.
